## 1. Purpose & one-line summary

Every `always` block describes one logical concern; the block kind (`always_ff` vs `always_comb`) and the assignment kind (`<=` vs `=`) together determine the hardware. This doc supplies the register and combinational-block discipline rules an agent applies to every block it writes for the Cyclone V (`5CSEBA6U23I7`) target: one driver per signal, blocking-in-comb / nonblocking-in-seq, defaults to prevent latches, secondary control signals shaped so Quartus infers the flop's full feature set, and — load-bearing — one logical concern per block. Reset construction (async-assert/sync-release), FSM coding patterns, pipeline-register discipline, and Quartus report mechanics are deferred to the docs named in `Load with:`.

## 3. Constructs / signals / API reference

### 3.1 The canonical `always_ff` block

The canonical synchronous-reset (or async-assert) sequential block: reset-first conditional, NBA-only body, one register's worth of state per block. The verbatim Verilog-2001 reference is FPGADesignElements `Register.v` (synchronous-clear flavour); the SV reframing follows lowRISC's `_q`/`_d` naming. (Reset *construction* — sync-release synchroniser, polarity, fanout — is doc 11.)

```verilog
// https://github.com/laforest/FPGADesignElements/blob/2450a548eeee2a4dc1c06878b7c00617dd94e2a8/Register.v#L65-L73 @ commit 2450a54
    always @(posedge clock) begin
        if (clock_enable == 1'b1) begin
            data_out <= data_in;
        end

        if (clear == 1'b1) begin
            data_out <= RESET_VALUE;
        end
    end
```

The above relies on the "last-assignment-wins" idiom for synchronous clear: both `if` statements may fire in the same edge, and the standard guarantees the second NBA supersedes the first on the bit it touches. The async-reset flavour cannot use that idiom — it requires the structural `if (areset) ... else ...` priority:

```verilog
// https://github.com/laforest/FPGADesignElements/blob/2450a548eeee2a4dc1c06878b7c00617dd94e2a8/Register_areset.v#L89-L102 @ commit 2450a54
    always @(posedge clock, posedge areset) begin
        if (areset == 1'b1) begin
            data_out <= RESET_VALUE;
        end
        else begin
            if (clock_enable == 1'b1) begin
                data_out <= data_in;
            end

            if (clear == 1'b1) begin
                data_out <= RESET_VALUE;
            end
        end
    end
```

Reframed in the SV subset (active-low async reset, `_q`/`_d` naming) the same shape is the lowRISC canonical form:

```systemverilog
// https://github.com/lowRISC/style-guides/blob/735d9112220033467e930b9afff250f76794a6fd/VerilogCodingStyle.md @ commit 735d911
always_ff @(posedge clk or negedge rst_ni) begin
  if (!rst_ni) begin
    foo_q <= 8'hab;
  end else if (foo_en) begin
    foo_q <= foo_d;
  end
end
```

The sync-reset SV form drops the second event term:

```systemverilog
// constructed from lowrisc_systemverilog_style.md sync-reset pattern @ 2026-05-19
always_ff @(posedge clk) begin
  if (rst) begin
    foo_q <= 8'hab;
  end else if (foo_en) begin
    foo_q <= foo_d;
  end
end
```

| Construct | Type | Meaning | Driven by | Drives |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `always_ff @(posedge clk)` | SV procedural block | Synchronous-reset sequential block. Body executes on rising `clk` only. | Source clock | Registers assigned via `<=` |
| `always_ff @(posedge clk or negedge rst_ni)` | SV procedural block | Async-assert / async-release flop (or async-assert sync-release with external reset synchroniser per doc 11). | Source clock, reset deassertion | Same |
| `<=` (nonblocking) | Assignment | Schedules RHS-read-now, LHS-update-end-of-step. The only legal assignment inside `always_ff`. | RHS expression at edge | LHS register at end of delta cycle |
| `_q` suffix (lowRISC) | Naming convention | Current/registered value of a flop. | The flop | Downstream logic |
| `_d` suffix (lowRISC) | Naming convention | Next-state input feeding the flop. | Upstream `always_comb` | The flop's `<=` RHS |
| `RESET_VALUE` | localparam | Value the register assumes on reset. | Module parameter | Initial/reset assignment |

### 3.2 The canonical `always_comb` block

Combinational blocks assign defaults at the top, then override per path. The "every output assigned on every path" property is enforced either by exhaustive `if`/`case` arms (each writing every output) or by the cheaper top-of-block default-assignment idiom shown below.

```systemverilog
// https://github.com/lowRISC/style-guides/blob/735d9112220033467e930b9afff250f76794a6fd/VerilogCodingStyle.md @ commit 735d911
always_comb begin
  // common default assignments
  state_d = state_q;
  outa = 1'b0;
  outb = 1'b0;
  outc = 1'b0;

  unique case (state_q)
    Idle: begin
      state_d = Work;
      outa = in0;
    end
    Work: begin
      state_d = Wait;
      outb = in1;
    end
    Wait: begin
      state_d = Idle;
      outc = in2;
    end
    // always include a default case
    // empty default permissible due to defaults before case block
    default: ;
  endcase
end
```

The defaults appearing once at the top mean each `case` arm only mentions the outputs it changes; nothing the arm omits floats, so no latch is inferred. `unique case` adds a simulation-time assertion that the cases are mutually exclusive without changing synthesis behaviour. Compared to plain Verilog `always @*`, `always_comb` adds three guarantees the synthesis-mandated discipline depends on:

```html
<!-- https://www.verilogpro.com/systemverilog-always_comb-always_ff/:Update: always_comb @ 2022-04 -->
- always_comb automatically executes once at time zero
- Variables on the left-hand side of assignments within an always_comb procedure
  cannot be written to by any other processes
- Statements in an always_comb cannot include those that block, have blocking
  timing or event controls, or fork-join statements
```

The middle bullet is how SV enforces the single-driver rule inside the procedural construct: writing the same `_d` from two `always_comb` blocks is a compile-time error rather than a silent multi-driver that simulators tolerate differently.

| Construct | Type | Meaning | Driven by | Drives |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `always_comb` | SV procedural block | Combinational logic. Implicit sensitivity = RHS signals. Tool warns on latch inference. | RHS signal changes | Combinational outputs assigned via `=` |
| `=` (blocking) | Assignment | Executes immediately; later statements see the new value. The only legal assignment inside `always_comb`. | RHS expression | LHS net or var |
| Default assignment | Statement at top of `always_comb` | Establishes a baseline value for every output the block can write. Prevents latch inference if a branch omits an output. | n/a | Combinational outputs |
| `unique case` | SV case-modifier | Asserts (sim) that at most one case-item matches. Does not change synthesis. | n/a | n/a |
| `default:` (in case) | Case arm | Catch-all that prevents latch inference when no defaults precede the case. | n/a | Combinational outputs |

### 3.3 Secondary control signals (Intel inference hooks)

A Cyclone V Adaptive Logic Module (ALM) flop has built-in support for clock enable, synchronous clear, asynchronous clear, and synchronous load. To engage these on-cell features instead of building them out of LUT fabric, write the canonical RTL pattern Intel's inference recognises. The patterns below are the ones Intel's *Register and Latch Coding Guidelines* names, restated in the SV subset.

| Feature | Canonical SV pattern | Effect on inferred flop |
|---|---|---|
| Clock enable | `if (en) q <= d;` | Engages the ALM flop's CE input — no extra LUT mux. |
| Synchronous clear | `if (clr_s) q <= '0; else q <= d;` | Engages the flop's SCLR input — combined with CE if both are present. |
| Asynchronous clear | `always_ff @(posedge clk or posedge clr_a) if (clr_a) q <= '0; else q <= d;` | Engages the flop's ACLR input — exclusive of certain other secondaries; see Intel guidance. |
| Synchronous load | `if (load) q <= d_in; else q <= q_next;` | Engages the flop's SLOAD path — preserves CE/SCLR availability when patterned cleanly. |

Source for the patterns and the inference behaviour: Intel *Register and Latch Coding Guidelines* (`https://docs.altera.com/r/docs/683323/18.1/intel-quartus-prime-standard-edition-user-guide-design-recommendations/register-and-latch-coding-guidelines`, live URL — local capture is an app-shell). [V] for the patterns themselves; the Cyclone V ALM cell features they engage are documented in the Cyclone V Device Handbook.

Mixing more than one *asynchronous* secondary control on the same flop (e.g., async preset and async clear together) typically defeats inference and forces fabric build-out; polarity, fanout, and the async-assert / sync-release combination are doc 11's concern.

### 3.4 One-concern-per-block discipline

The rule: write one `always_ff` per register (or per tightly coupled register group representing a single state element), one `always_comb` per combinational concern (next-state, output decode, address generation, etc.). The lowRISC style guide states it directly:

```markdown
// https://github.com/lowRISC/style-guides/blob/735d9112220033467e930b9afff250f76794a6fd/VerilogCodingStyle.md @ commit 735d911
Keep work in sequential blocks simple. If a sequential block becomes
sufficiently complicated, consider splitting the combinational logic into a
separate combinational (`always_comb`) block. Ideally, sequential blocks should
contain only a register instantiation, with perhaps a load enable or an
increment.
```

A counterexample (the monolithic pattern this rule prohibits — see §7 #1 for the full Symptom→Cause→Fix treatment):

```systemverilog
// [I] synthesized for illustration; not from any corpus source — 2026-05-19
// BAD: one always block, every concern bundled
always_ff @(posedge clk) begin
  if (rst) begin
    counter_q <= '0;
    accum_q   <= '0;
    state_q   <= S_IDLE;
    out_q     <= '0;
  end else begin
    // counter concern
    if (count_en) counter_q <= counter_q + 1'b1;
    // accumulator concern
    if (sample_v) accum_q <= accum_q + sample_d;
    // FSM next-state concern
    case (state_q)
      S_IDLE: if (start) state_q <= S_RUN;
      S_RUN:  if (counter_q == LIMIT) state_q <= S_DONE;
      S_DONE: state_q <= S_IDLE;
      default: state_q <= S_IDLE;
    endcase
    // output mux concern
    case (sel)
      2'd0: out_q <= counter_q[7:0];
      2'd1: out_q <= accum_q[7:0];
      2'd2: out_q <= {6'd0, state_q};
      default: out_q <= '0;
    endcase
  end
end
```

The refactor: one `always_ff` per concern, with `always_comb` blocks computing the per-cycle decisions:

```systemverilog
// [I] synthesized for illustration; the refactor of the block above — 2026-05-19
// GOOD: one block per logical concern
always_ff @(posedge clk) begin
  if (rst)              counter_q <= '0;
  else if (count_en)    counter_q <= counter_q + 1'b1;
end

always_ff @(posedge clk) begin
  if (rst)              accum_q <= '0;
  else if (sample_v)    accum_q <= accum_q + sample_d;
end

always_ff @(posedge clk) begin
  if (rst) state_q <= S_IDLE;
  else     state_q <= state_d;
end

always_comb begin
  state_d = state_q;
  unique case (state_q)
    S_IDLE: if (start) state_d = S_RUN;
    S_RUN:  if (counter_q == LIMIT) state_d = S_DONE;
    S_DONE: state_d = S_IDLE;
    default: state_d = S_IDLE;
  endcase
end

always_comb begin
  out_d = '0;
  unique case (sel)
    2'd0: out_d = counter_q[7:0];
    2'd1: out_d = accum_q[7:0];
    2'd2: out_d = {6'd0, state_q};
    default: out_d = '0;
  endcase
end

always_ff @(posedge clk) begin
  if (rst) out_q <= '0;
  else     out_q <= out_d;
end
```

| Pattern | Counts as one concern? | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Single register + its enable/clear/load | Yes | Canonical `always_ff` shape; §3.1. |
| FSM state register | Yes | One `always_ff` for the state vector; partner `always_comb` for next-state (§3.2). |
| Pipeline stage (multiple flops, same valid) | Yes (per stage) | Per doc 15; valid-follows-data lives at the stage boundary. |
| "Every register in the module" | No | This is the monolithic pattern §7 #1 prohibits. |
| "FSM + datapath + output mux" | No | Three concerns at least; split each. |

## 4. Sequencing & timing

The discipline rules exist because of two specific scheduling semantics:

- `always_ff` evaluates all RHS expressions at the active clock edge, then schedules NBA updates that take effect after all RHS reads in the same delta cycle. In Cummings's "two-region" model, the RHS-read region for every clocked block in the design runs before any LHS-update region. This is *why* nonblocking-in-seq is mandatory: it produces the register-swap semantics (`a <= b; b <= a;` swaps cleanly in hardware) that match a real flop. Source: Cummings, *Nonblocking Assignments in Verilog Synthesis* (`http://www.sunburst-design.com/papers/CummingsSNUG2000SJ_NBA.pdf`, live URL — no local capture).
- `always_comb` re-evaluates whenever any RHS signal changes; statements run in source order with blocking assignments so each subsequent line sees the latest value of variables written above it. The result is still combinational: there is no clock, no edge, no stored state — but the body reads as straight-line dependency order. This is *why* blocking-in-comb is mandatory: blocking matches the data-flow semantics the synthesised LUT cone implements. Source: VerilogPro *Verilog Always Block* (`[Verilog Pro: Verilog always block](https://www.verilogpro.com/verilog-always-block/):Modeling Combinational Logic @ 2022-04`).

The NBA register-swap sequence, for the canonical `a <= b; b <= a;` example:

```
                t = T (clk rising edge)
                |
RHS reads:      a_rhs = a   b_rhs = b      (all blocks' RHS computed)
                |
LHS updates:    a <= b_rhs  b <= a_rhs     (all blocks' NBA scheduled, then applied)
                |
                t = T + delta : a == old_b, b == old_a   (clean swap)
```

If `=` were used instead, the first line would update `a` to `b` immediately, and the second line would then write the *new* `a` (i.e. `b`) into `b`, losing the swap. That is the simulation race the discipline prevents.

Per-cycle / per-protocol timing diagrams for the secondary control signals (CE / SCLR / ACLR / SLOAD) and for reset deassertion windows belong to doc 11 (reset/clock) and doc 41 (Quartus reports / setup-hold).

## 5. Minimal working pattern

An 8-bit register with clock enable, synchronous clear, and synchronous load, written as one `always_ff` block in the canonical SV subset. The structure follows FPGADesignElements `Register.v` (`[`FPGADesignElements/Register.v:65-73`](https://github.com/laforest/FPGADesignElements/blob/2450a548eeee2a4dc1c06878b7c00617dd94e2a8/Register.v#L65-L73) @ commit 2450a54`) reframed with explicit priority (reset → clear → load → enable):

```systemverilog
// [I] composite: structure from FPGADesignElements Register.v:65-73 @ 2450a54
//                 reframed in SV subset per lowrisc_systemverilog_style.md:1830-1836 @ 735d911
module register_8b (
  input  logic       clk,
  input  logic       rst,        // synchronous reset
  input  logic       clear,      // synchronous clear to zero
  input  logic       load,       // synchronous parallel load
  input  logic       enable,     // clock enable
  input  logic [7:0] load_data,
  input  logic [7:0] next_data,
  output logic [7:0] q
);

  always_ff @(posedge clk) begin
    if (rst)        q <= 8'h00;          // priority 1: reset
    else if (clear) q <= 8'h00;          // priority 2: sync clear
    else if (load)  q <= load_data;      // priority 3: sync load
    else if (enable) q <= next_data;     // priority 4: clock enable
    // implicit else: q holds (last-assignment-wins / no-write hold)
  end

endmodule
```

This is the working pattern. Note: it is one `always_ff` block, holding one register, with the reset-first conditional and only NBA assignments — every rule from §2 visible in seventeen lines.

## 6. Common variations across implementations

- [O] **lowRISC SV style** (`[lowRISC SystemVerilog style guide 1830-1836](https://github.com/lowRISC/style-guides/blob/735d9112220033467e930b9afff250f76794a6fd/VerilogCodingStyle.md#L1830-L1836), [2839-2885](https://github.com/lowRISC/style-guides/blob/735d9112220033467e930b9afff250f76794a6fd/VerilogCodingStyle.md#L2839-L2885) @ commit 735d911`): `always_ff @(posedge clk or negedge rst_ni)` with active-low async reset; sequential and combinational blocks always separated; `_q`/`_d` suffix convention; states declared as `typedef enum`; FSM is always two blocks (one `always_comb` for next-state-plus-outputs, one `always_ff` for the state register).
- [O] **FPGADesignElements style** (`[`FPGADesignElements/Register.v:39-75`](https://github.com/laforest/FPGADesignElements/blob/2450a548eeee2a4dc1c06878b7c00617dd94e2a8/Register.v#L39-L75) @ commit 2450a54`, `Register_areset.v:51-104 @ commit 2450a54`): Verilog-2001 with synchronous reset as the default *and a separate module* (`Register_areset`) for async-reset cases; one `always` block per primitive; `data_out`/`data_in` naming; relies on the "last-assignment-wins" idiom for sync clear (two `if` blocks at the same level, second wins on overlap); `initial` block sets power-on value; `` `default_nettype none `` at top of every file.
- [O] **Cummings FSM-paper two-block idiom** ([Cummings, SNUG 1998 FSM](http://www.sunburst-design.com/papers/CummingsSNUG1998SJ_FSM.pdf)): one sequential `always @(posedge clk or posedge rst)` for the state register (only `state <= next;` on the non-reset path), and one combinational `always @(state or ...)` for next-state assignment with a default `next = 3'bx;` (or `next = state;`) at the top. The block-discipline split is the relevant detail here; full FSM coding patterns are doc 14.
- [O] **VerilogPro classic Verilog-2001** ([Verilog Pro: Verilog always block](https://www.verilogpro.com/verilog-always-block/)): minimal flop pattern `always @(posedge clk or negedge rst_n) if (!rst_n) q <= 1'b0; else q <= d;` with the reset on the sensitivity list; two separate flop blocks preferred over one combined block when no shared logic exists.

Not used in this bundle: verbose one-hot encoded state vectors with `// synopsys full_case parallel_case` pragmas (Cummings FSM PDF discusses; lowRISC explicitly forbids `full_case`/`parallel_case` — see [lowRISC SystemVerilog style guide 2163-2164](https://github.com/lowRISC/style-guides/blob/735d9112220033467e930b9afff250f76794a6fd/VerilogCodingStyle.md#L2163-L2164)).

## 7. Anti-patterns (mistakes that compile but break)

### #1 Monolithic `always` block

- **Symptom:** A single `always @(posedge clk)` block of 50–500 lines bundles reset, every register update, FSM next-state, and one or more output muxes into one cascade. Bugs are correlated — a typo in one branch corrupts an unrelated register. fmax becomes opaque because the synthesiser's hands are tied around the whole construct. Code review degenerates into reverse-engineering a state diagram from nested `if`/`case`. Adding a sixth concern to a five-concern block reliably introduces a regression in one of the existing five.
- **Cause:** Writing the design as if it were one sequential program. The block "feels" like `main()` and accretes responsibilities. A second contributing cause: starting from a textbook two-line flop pattern, growing it concern by concern, and never pausing to refactor when the third concern arrives.
- **Fix:** Refactor into one block per logical concern. Concretely: one `always_ff` per register (or per tightly coupled register group representing a single state element — e.g., the in-flight valid bits of a pipeline stage); one `always_comb` per next-state decoder, output decoder, address generator, or shared combinational computation. Use `_q`/`_d` naming to make the wire between the combinational decision and the register storage explicit. The refactor is mechanical: list the registers in the monolith, give each its own `always_ff`, then lift each `case`/`if` cascade that was computing a next-value into its own `always_comb` driving the matching `_d`. The transformation is shown in §3.4 (counterexample and refactor); the minimum-working register lives in §5; the FSM-specific application of the same rule is doc 14.

The counterexample / refactor pair in §3.4 is constructed for illustration ([I]); the citations above establish the *rule* the counterexample violates, but neither lowRISC nor Cummings published a verbatim monolithic block to quote.

### #2 Mixed blocking and nonblocking assignments in one block

- **Symptom:** Simulation race conditions visible as run-to-run nondeterminism on the same testbench; sim/synth mismatch where a register appears to advance two states in one cycle in simulation but only one in hardware (or vice versa); signals "jumping" registers between simulator runs.
- **Cause:** Using `=` and `<=` in the same `always` block. The simulator may interpret some of the blocking assignments as taking effect in a different simulation event than the nonblocking assignments; what looks like a single delta cycle in source becomes two scheduled regions. lowRISC summarises this as "potentially leading to total protonic reversal. That's bad."
- **Fix:** `always_ff` uses only `<=`; `always_comb` uses only `=`. If you need to compute something with the sequential ordering of blocking assignments before registering it, put the blocking sequence in an `always_comb` block writing `_d` signals, and register the result in an `always_ff` block doing only `q <= d`.

### #3 Combinational feedback loop

- **Symptom:** Quartus Synthesis report logs `combinational loop` on the offending node. If the tool tolerates the loop (some pure-comb paths self-stabilise), the output glitches at simulation time and settles to an unintended value in hardware, with timing analysis reporting `(loop)` on the worst path so no real fmax number is produced. In `always_comb` form, the LRM-mandated single-driver rule may produce a compile error rather than a warning.
- **Cause:** A pure-combinational signal appears in its own RHS cone — either directly (`assign x = x | y;`) or through a chain of combinational logic that closes back on itself. Common sub-cases: a default assignment that omits a self-update so the LHS appears on the RHS of a downstream expression; an output of an `always_comb` block fed back into the same block; a wire chain assembled across modules where the loop crosses a hierarchy boundary.
- **Fix:** Insert a register on the feedback path (i.e., move the loop closure through a flop, making the path register-bounded so the timing analyser can constrain it) or re-derive the signal so it no longer appears in its own cone. Detection: search the Quartus Synthesis report for `combinational loop`; doc 41 covers report mechanics.

  - FPGACPU verilog coding standard: [fpgacpu.ca Verilog Coding Standard](http://fpgacpu.ca/fpga/verilog.html) ("if you find you have a backwards dependency between blocking assignments… either re-order the assignments, or split one assignment off into its own `always()` block. Otherwise, the simulation and synthesis will still be correct, but they may not match anymore.")

### #4 Latch inferred from incomplete combinational coverage

- **Symptom:** Quartus Synthesis report contains `inferred latch` for a signal that was meant to be a wire; gate count is unexpectedly large or includes latches in the resource summary; behaviour in hardware differs from RTL simulation, particularly around reset, because the latch retains a value rather than evaluating combinationally. In SystemVerilog with `always_comb`, the tool typically also raises a "latch implied" warning.
- **Cause:** An `always_comb` block whose output is not assigned on every execution path: an `if` without `else`, an `if`/`elseif` chain missing the trailing `else`, or a `case` statement missing `default` (with the case selector taking an unenumerated value, or simulating to `X`).
- **Fix:** Two equivalent disciplines, both acceptable:
  1. **Top-of-block defaults.** Assign every output its baseline value as the first statements after `begin`, then override per branch (the §3.2 pattern). Each `case` arm only mentions the outputs it changes; nothing the arm omits floats.
  2. **Exhaustive arms.** Every `if`/`elseif` chain ends with `else`; every `case` statement ends with `default:`; every arm writes every output. Less compact than #1, sometimes necessary when the defaults would be misleading.

  For SV `case` statements, `unique`/`priority` adds a simulation assertion that catches an unintended overlap or unenumerated value before it becomes a runtime latch — but does *not* substitute for a `default` arm. Always include `default:`.

Failing to do this can lead to a simulation/synthesis mismatch.")
  - VerilogPro *SystemVerilog always_comb, always_ff*: `[Verilog Pro: always_comb, always_ff](https://www.verilogpro.com/systemverilog-always_comb-always_ff/):Update: always_comb @ 2022-04` (the SV-specific guarantees that make this enforceable at compile time rather than only via lint).

## 8. Verification

Quartus Synthesis-report strings to grep for after every compile (full report-reading mechanics deferred to doc 41):

- `inferred latch` — a signal that should have been combinational is being held; cross-check against the §7 #4 fix.
- `combinational loop` — feedback path missing a register; cross-check against §7 #3.
- `multi-driver` (and the related `net has multiple drivers`) — the single-driver rule (§2) was violated; find the second driver and remove it.
- `Latch.* inferred` / `Implicit latch` (vendor-tool warning class for SV `always_comb`) — same root cause as `inferred latch`; SV gives an earlier, sharper warning.

Lint expectations:

- `always_comb` triggers a tool warning when the block's sensitivity (i.e., the implicit RHS list) is incomplete — usually because of a blocking-in-blocking back-reference (the VerilogPro "watch out for" example in §3.2).
- `always_ff` triggers a warning if any path writes the LHS using a blocking (`=`) assignment, exactly matching the §2 [C] rule.

Simulation discipline:

- Unit test that asserts the post-reset value of every register named in the module. Two assertions per register: one at `t=0` after reset is released, one after a known-good stimulus sequence. This is the cheapest way to catch a missing `else` in an `always_ff` and the cheapest way to catch a latch inferred for what was meant to be a `_d` wire.
- For combinational blocks, a sweep stimulus across all input combinations within reason (≤16-bit inputs are tractable) catches latches that survived synthesis by exposing the "held" value on a transition that should have re-evaluated.

SVA handshake assertions and broader verification methodology live in doc 41.
