# Cyclone V HDL Bundle — Index

> Bundle version: 2026-05-19
> Target part: Intel Cyclone V SoC `5CSEBA6U23I7` (Terasic DE10-Nano)
> Target toolchain: Intel Quartus Standard/Lite 18.1-era HDL coding guidance
> Language: SystemVerilog synthesis-safe subset (see [12-synthesizable-sv-subset.md](12-synthesizable-sv-subset.md))
> Scope: generic Cyclone V HDL practice — framework-agnostic; MiSTer wrapper not covered.

## What this bundle is

A drop-in reference for an AI agent that writes Verilog/SystemVerilog for Cyclone V FPGAs. It teaches:

- Parallel/pipelined microarchitecture thinking rather than software transliteration.
- The synthesizable SystemVerilog subset that maps cleanly to Cyclone V resources.
- Clock-domain, reset, and CDC discipline.
- Ready/valid handshakes, FIFOs, skid buffers.
- Cyclone V resource inference (M10K, MLAB, variable-precision DSP).
- Timing closure mindset, basic SDC, Quartus report reading.
- Verification expectations with light SVA handshake assertions.
- Resource economy (every register and bus bit must justify itself).
- Era-faithful microarchitecture for emulation cores (mirror the original chip).

## What this bundle is NOT

- The MiSTer framework wrapper (`sys_top.sv`, `hps_io`, status word, framework video/audio conventions). Covered by a separate companion bundle if needed.
- Vendor-IP wizards (beyond a brief "when to instantiate IP" note).
- Soft-CPU bring-up (Nios II), HPS-FPGA bridges, OpenCL.
- Deep formal verification (SymbiYosys, k-induction). Light SVA handshake assertions only.
- High-speed transceivers, DDR3 controller IP, PCIe.
- Tooling beyond Quartus Standard/Lite 18.1-era.

## Claim labels (load-bearing)

Every factual sentence in §2, §3, and §6 of every topic doc carries exactly one of:

- **[C] Contract** — strictly required by the upstream framework/protocol/synthesis. Violation breaks correctness.
- **[V] Convention** — common pattern not strictly required; violating is allowed but unusual.
- **[O] Observed in implementation X** — present in a specific instance at a specific revision; the instance is named.
- **[I] Inference** — synthesized from multiple sources; no single citation establishes it. Treat with care.

When loading topic docs, weight assertions accordingly: a [C] rule is non-negotiable; an [I] rule is a judgment call that depends on context.

## How to use the bundle

**Always load first:**

1. [00-INDEX.md](00-INDEX.md) (this file).
2. [01-glossary.md](01-glossary.md) — terms used throughout.
3. [02-source-map.md](02-source-map.md) — citation hub.

**Then selectively load topic docs relevant to your task.** Each topic doc declares its `Load with:` dependencies — load those too.

**For a cold start** (new agent, no prior context on the project):

- Read 10 (mindset), 12 (language subset), 13 (registers/comb), 16 (resource economy), 17 (era-faithful microarchitecture). That's the foundation.
- Then load topic-specific docs as the task requires.

**For review of completed RTL:**

- Load [91-core-bringup-checklist.md](91-core-bringup-checklist.md) for the sequential gate checklist.
- Load [90-anti-patterns.md](90-anti-patterns.md) and grep for symptoms.
